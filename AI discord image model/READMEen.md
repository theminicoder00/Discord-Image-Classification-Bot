The bot in this project I made helps you sort waste and makes some of your life easier ğŸ™‚. 
The model we train and use in the bot knows 6 types of waste and allows you to separate these wastes and make recycling easier ğŸ¤— 
ğŸš€ Since examples from daily life are used in the model, we believe that it will help you. ğŸš€
